# Game Design Documents Portfolio 

# Who am I?

## I'm Yann Chatila
I'm a video game developer specializing in **Game Design and Programming**. 

I started creating my own video games projects in **2021** alongside **Cinema and audiovisual studies** in Paris. I then embarked on a 3-year course in video games at ESMA, located in Rennes, France.

My main skills are geared towards **Game Design** and **Programmation**, which I showcase in my [main portfolio](https://github.com/Doerys/Portfolio/blob/main/README.md). But this portfolio mainly focus on game projects. Here, I focus more on **[Game Designer's key documentations](GameDesign_Projects.md)**, such as Game Design Documents or Game Concept Documents.
